# AI_Codes
This repository contains my lab files for Artificial Intelligence (AI) projects. The files include source code, data sets, and output files that were created as part of my coursework.

Each lab file corresponds to a specific AI concept or application, and includes a brief description of the project's purpose and functionality. The files are organized by lab session and cover a range of topics, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

The lab files also include documentation that provides an overview of the AI concepts used and the results obtained. This documentation can be used as a reference guide for anyone interested in AI or for those who are looking to expand their knowledge and skills in this area.

Overall, these lab files provide a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about AI. They are suitable for students, researchers, and professionals who are interested in exploring and applying AI in their work. The lab files include the use of popular AI libraries and frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.
